## Github-ish stuff

- Gitignore the .vscode folder (ditto .DS_Store)
  - add .vscode to gitignore
  - git rm -rf --cached .
  - git add -A
  - git commit -m "whatever"
- Update your readme, probably something clever about pi√±atas (good for sharing with future employers)
- Recommend standard / clean / descriptive git commit message format, like [this one](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/semantic_commit_messages)
- Nice pull requests, good description
- In pull request: reference the trello card
- It's great that you are reviewing each others PRs, leave comments when needed

## Code style

- Make an .eslintrc.json so that you can customize linting code style messages
